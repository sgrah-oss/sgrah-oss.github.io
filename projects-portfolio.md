## TotalEnergies Digital Factory <img src="../images/totalenergies-logo.png?raw=true" width="100" height="100" />
_Since March 2021._

### OneCBM, a platform that helps engineers monitoring equipment on [FPSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_production_storage_and_offloading) equipments
**Data Scientist in the squad team.** \
The product has been under development at TotalEnergies' Digital Factory for a year. The product team 
is composed of a tech lead, a product owner, 2 data engineers, 2 software engineers, a devops engineer,
a product manager, a dynamic lead (scrum master / agile coach) and 3 data scientists. \
We use Databricks and Azure Cloud. Our language is Python. Spark is required only for preprocessing datasets
using batch treatment scheduled every day. We implement the full lifecycle of machine learning models,
including modeling, unit/integration tests, versioning of artifacts (models, data and code), training, deployment,
evaluation, monitoring, orchestration. The whole process is automated via a CI/CD that launches and 
executes Databricks pipeline tasks on several environments: test, pre-prod and production. 
The environments are set up using the infra-as-code approach with Terraform. 
Models, results, etc... are monitored with MLFlow.
In the team, we decided to use trunk-based development to merge our features using pull requests. \
Finally, we follow Agile values and apply the scrum methodology with all rituals
(2 week sprint and 8 sprint cycle with a scoping "sprint" at the beginning).

### Data Studio Team
+9 Proof of Concept projects for all group entities. \
It is called data exploration and lasts about 6 weeks. \
Examples of topics addressed: Predictive Maintenance, Supply Chain, Dynamic Pricing,
Root Cause Analysis, Knowledge Extraction, Anomaly Detection, Solar Power Station forecasting. \

## Cybels Analytics, an AI-based Platform for detecting cyberattacks  <img src="../images/thales.png?raw=true" width="100" height="50" />
_2019._ \
[press release](https://thales-group.prezly.com/thales-unveils-cybels-analytics-its-new-ai-based-platform-to-detect-the-most-complex-cyberattacks)\
**Head of AI and ML**. I also worked on the Data Engineering and Devops part. \
*Data Engineering*: a large amount of data was being consumed by the platform (about 600 log messages per second).
We were relying on the following stack: Spark streaming (scala and python API), Elasticsearch, Kibana and Logstash. \
*Devops*: the platform was deployed on-premise with virtual machines set up in a distributed cluster of machines. 
Ansible was used to automate the process. \
*Machine Learning*: I built algorithms based on anomaly detection and graph theory to detect cyberattacks
(such as Command and Control, DDos, etc…) and provided modules on the platform that could be reused by expert users
to design their own pipelines and processing. Algorithms were implemented in scala and python for Spark. \
The platform was presented at the 2020 edition of the International Cybersecurity Forum (FIC)
